    "In this quickstart, you will deploy a suite of IoT services to an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster so that you can remotely manage your devices and workloads. Azure IoT Operations Preview is a digital operations suite of services that includes Azure IoT Orchestrator. This quickstart guides you through using Orchestrator to deploy these services to a Kubernetes cluster. At the end of the quickstart, you have a cluster that you can manage from the cloud that's generating sample data to use in the following quickstarts.\n",

    "* [Azure IoT Orchestrator](../deploy-custom/overview-orchestrator.md)\n",

    "\n",
    "Review the prerequisites based on the environment you use to host the Kubernetes cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this quickstart, we recommend GitHub Codespaces as a quick way to get started in a virtual environment without installing new tools. Or, use AKS Edge Essentials to create a cluster on Windows devices or K3s on Ubuntu Linux devices.\n",

    "## What problem will we solve?\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure IoT Operations is a suite of data services that run on Kubernetes clusters. You want these clusters to be managed remotely from the cloud, and able to securely communicate with cloud resources and endpoints. We address these concerns with the following tasks in this quickstart:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connect a Kubernetes cluster to Azure Arc for remote management.\n",
    "1. Create an Azure Key Vault to manage secrets for your cluster.\n",
    "1. Configure your cluster with a secrets store and service principal to communicate with cloud resources.\n",
    "1. Deploy Azure IoT Operations to your cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connect a Kubernetes cluster to Azure Arc\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure IoT Operations should work on any Kubernetes cluster that conforms to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) standards. For this quickstart, use GitHub Codespaces, AKS Edge Essentials on Windows, or K3s on Ubuntu Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use GitHub Codespaces to try Azure IoT Operations on a Kubernetes cluster without installing anything on your local machine. Use the **explore-iot-operations** codespace that is preconfigured with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [K3s](https://k3s.io/) running in [K3d](https://k3d.io/) for a lightweight Kubernetes cluster\n",
    "- [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)\n",
    "- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) for managing Kubernetes resources\n",
    "- Other useful tools like [Helm](https://helm.sh/) and [k9s](https://k9scli.io/)\n",
    "\n",
    "> [!IMPORTANT]\n",
    "> Codespaces are easy to set up quickly and tear down later, but they're not suitable for performance evaluation or scale testing. Use GitHub Codespaces for exploration only.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with your codespace:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create the codespace, entering your Azure details to store them as environment variables for the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "   [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/Azure-Samples/explore-iot-operations?quickstart=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your codespace should open automatically. If not, open it from the **Codespaces** tab in GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "To connect your cluster to Azure Arc:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sign in to Azure CLI on your development machine or in your codespace terminal. To prevent potential permission issues later, sign in interactively with a browser here even if you've already logged in before.\n",
    "\n",
    "```azurecli\n",

    "<b>NOTE</b>\n",

    "* Open the codespace in VS Code desktop, and then run `az login` again in the browser terminal.\n",
