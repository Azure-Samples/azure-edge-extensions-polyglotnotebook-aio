    "Azure IoT Operations is a suite of data services that run on Kubernetes clusters. You want these clusters to be managed remotely from the cloud, and able to securely communicate with cloud resources and endpoints. We address these concerns with the following tasks in this quickstart:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Connect a Kubernetes cluster to Azure Arc for remote management.\n",
    "1. Create an Azure Key Vault to manage secrets for your cluster.\n",
    "1. Configure your cluster with a secrets store and service principal to communicate with cloud resources.\n",
    "1. Deploy Azure IoT Operations to your cluster.\n",

    "\n",
    "Azure IoT Operations should work on any Kubernetes cluster that conforms to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) standards. For this quickstart, use GitHub Codespaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect your cluster to Azure Arc:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sign in to Azure CLI on your development machine or in your codespace terminal. To prevent potential permission issues later, sign in interactively with a browser here even if you've already logged in before.\n",
