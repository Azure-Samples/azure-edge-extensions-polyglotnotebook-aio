#CustomerIntent: As an operator, I want to send data from a pipeline to the reference data store so that I can use the reference data to contextualize and enrich messages in other pipelines.

# Send data to the reference data store

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-note](../includes/public-preview-note.md)]

Use the _Reference datasets_ destination to write data to the internal reference data store. You use the data stored in reference datasets is used to enrich data streams with [contextual information](concept-contextualization.md).

## Prerequisites

To configure and use an Azure Data Explorer destination pipeline stage, you need a deployed instance of Azure IoT Data Processor (preview).

## Configure the destination stage

The reference datasets destination stage JSON configuration defines the details of the stage. To author the stage, you can either interact with the form-based UI, or provide the JSON configuration on the **Advanced** tab:

| Field | Type | Description | Required | Default | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dataset  | String | The reference dataset to write to.  | Yes | -  | `equipmentData` |

You must [create the dataset](howto-configure-reference.md) before you can write to it.
