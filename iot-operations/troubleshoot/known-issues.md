# Known issues: Azure IoT Operations

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-note](../includes/public-preview-note.md)]

This article contains known issues for Azure IoT Operations Preview.

## Azure IoT Operations

- You must use the Azure CLI interactive login `az login`. If you don't, you might see an error such as _ERROR: AADSTS530003: Your device is required to be managed to access this resource_.

- Uninstalling K3s: When you uninstall k3s on Ubuntu by using the `/usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh` script, you might encounter an issue where the script gets stuck on unmounting the NFS pod. A workaround for this issue is to run the following command before you run the uninstall script: `sudo systemctl stop k3s`.

## Azure IoT MQ (preview)

- You can only access the default deployment by using the cluster IP, TLS, and a service account token. Clients outside the cluster need extra configuration before they can connect.

- You can't update the Broker custom resource after the initial deployment. You can't make configuration changes to cardinality, memory profile, or disk buffer.

- You can't configure the size of a disk-backed buffer unless your chosen storage class supports it.

- Even though IoT MQ's [diagnostic service](../monitor/howto-configure-diagnostics.md) produces telemetry on its own topic, you might still get messages from the self-test when you subscribe to `#` topic.

- Some clusters that have slow Kubernetes API calls might result in selftest ping failures and "Status {Failed}. Probe failed: Ping: 1/2" messages from az iot ops check

- When implementing Azure Event Grid and Kafka, you might encounter timeout errors in the logs. Despite these errors, the connector will continue to function and forward messages


## Layered Network Management (preview)

- If the Layered Network Management service isn't getting an IP address while running K3S on Ubuntu host, reinstall K3S without _trafeik ingress controller_ by using the `--disable=traefik` option.

    ```bash
    curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - --disable=traefik --write-kubeconfig-mode 644
    ```

    For more information, see [Networking | K3s](https://docs.k3s.io/networking#traefik-ingress-controller).

- If DNS queries aren't getting resolved to expected IP address while using [CoreDNS](../manage-layered-network/howto-configure-layered-network.md#configure-coredns) service running on child network level, upgrade to Ubuntu 22.04 and reinstall K3S.

## OPC UA Broker (preview)

- All AssetEndpointProfiles in the cluster have to be configured with the same transport authentication certificate, otherwise the OPC UA Broker might exhibit random behavior. To avoid this issue when using transport authentication, configure all asset endpoints with the same thumbprint for the transport authentication certificate in the Azure IoT Operations portal.

## OPC PLC simulator

If you create an asset endpoint for the OPC PLC simulator, but the OPC PLC simulator isn't sending data to the IoT MQ broker, try the following command:

- Patch the asset endpoint with `autoAcceptUntrustedServerCertificates=true`:

```bash
ENDPOINT_NAME=<name-of-you-endpoint-here>
kubectl patch AssetEndpointProfile $ENDPOINT_NAME \
-n azure-iot-operations \
--type=merge \
-p '{"spec":{"additionalConfiguration":"{\"applicationName\":\"'"$ENDPOINT_NAME"'\",\"security\":{\"autoAcceptUntrustedServerCertificates\":true}}"}}'
```

You can also patch all your asset endpoints with the following command:

```bash
ENDPOINTS=$(kubectl get AssetEndpointProfile -n azure-iot-operations --no-headers -o custom-columns=":metadata.name")
for ENDPOINT_NAME in `echo "$ENDPOINTS"`; do \
kubectl patch AssetEndpointProfile $ENDPOINT_NAME \
   -n azure-iot-operations \
   --type=merge \
   -p '{"spec":{"additionalConfiguration":"{\"applicationName\":\"'"$ENDPOINT_NAME"'\",\"security\":{\"autoAcceptUntrustedServerCertificates\":true}}"}}'; \
done
```

> [!WARNING]
> Don't use untrusted certificates in production environments.

If the OPC PLC simulator isn't sending data to the IoT MQ broker after you create a new asset, restart the OPC PLC simulator pod. The pod name looks like `aio-opc-opc.tcp-1-f95d76c54-w9v9c`. To restart the pod, use the `k9s` tool to kill the pod, or run the following command:

```bash
kubectl delete pod aio-opc-opc.tcp-1-f95d76c54-w9v9c -n azure-iot-operations
```

## Azure IoT Operations (preview) portal

To sign in to the Azure IoT Operations portal, you need a Microsoft Entra ID account with at least contributor permissions for the resource group that contains your **Kubernetes - Azure Arc** instance. You can't sign in with a Microsoft account (MSA). To create an account in your Azure tenant:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with the same tenant and user name that you used to deploy Azure IoT Operations.
1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Microsoft Entra ID** section, select **Users > +New user > Create new user**. Create a new user and make a note of the password, you need it to sign in later.
1. In the Azure portal, navigate to the resource group that contains your **Kubernetes - Azure Arc** instance. On the **Access control (IAM)** page, select **+Add > Add role assignment**.
1. On the **Add role assignment page**, select **Privileged administrator roles**. Then select **Contributor** and then select **Next**.
1. On the **Members** page, add your new user to the role.
1. Select **Review and assign** to complete setting up the new user.

You can now use the new user account to sign in to the [Azure IoT Operations portal](https://iotoperations.azure.com).
