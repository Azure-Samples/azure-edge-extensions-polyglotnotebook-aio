OPC UA (OPC Unified Architecture) is a standard developed by the [OPC Foundation](https://opcfoundation.org/) to exchange data between industrial components and the cloud. Industrial components can include physical devices such as sensors, actuators, controllers, and machines. Industrial components can also include logical elements such as processes, events, software-defined assets, and entire systems. The OPC UA standard enables industrial components that use it to communicate securely and exchange data at the edge, and in the cloud.  Because industrial components use a wide variety of protocols for communication and data exchange, it can be complex and costly to develop an integrated solution. The OPC UA standard is a widely used solution to this issue.  OPC UA provides a consistent, secure, documented standard based on widely used data formats. Industrial components can implement the OPC UA standard to enable universal data exchange.

Azure IoT OPC UA Broker (preview) enables you to connect to OPC UA servers, and to publish telemetry data from connected OPC UA industrial components. In Azure IoT Operations Preview, OPC UA Broker is the service that enables your industrial OPC UA environment to exchange data with your local workloads running on a cluster, and with the cloud. This article overviews what OPC UA Broker is and how it works with your industrial assets at the edge. 

## What is OPC UA Broker
OPC UA Broker is a client application that runs as a middleware service in Azure IoT Operations. OPC UA Broker connects to an OPC UA server, lets you browse the server address space, write data, and monitor data changes and events in connected assets. The main benefit of OPC UA Broker is that it simplifies the process to connect to local OPC UA systems. 

By using OPC UA Broker, operations teams and developers can streamline the task of connecting OPC UA assets to their industrial solution at the edge. As part of Azure IoT Operations, OPC UA Broker is shipped as a native K8s application that shows how to do the following tasks:
- Connect existing OPC UA servers and assets to a native Kubernetes K8s cluster at the edge
- Publish JSON-encoded telemetry data from OPC UA servers in OPC UA PubSub format, using a JSON payload
- Connect to Azure Arc-enabled services in the cloud
 
The following diagram illustrates the OPC UA architecture:

## OPC UA Broker features
OPC UA Broker (preview) supports the following features as part of the Azure IoT Operations Preview: 

- Simultaneous connections to multiple OPC UA servers configured via Kubernetes CRs 
- Publishing of OPC UA data value changes in OPC UA PubSub format in JSON encoding 
- Publishing of OPC UA events with predefined event fields 
- Asset definition via Kubernetes CRs 
- Support of payload compression (gzip, brotli) 
- Automatic reconnection to OPC UA servers 
- Integrated OpenTelemetry compatible observability 
- Support for OPC UA transport encryption 
- Anonymous authentication and authentication based on user and password
- Configurable via Azure REST API 
- Akri-supported asset detection of OPC UA assets (assets must be OPC UA Companion Specification compliant) 
- Secure by design

## What OPC UA Broker does
OPC UA Broker performs several essential functions for your edge solution and industrial assets. The following sections summarize what OPC UA Broker does in the application itself, and in the OPC UA Discovery Handler. 

### The application
OPC UA Broker implements retry logic to establish connections to endpoints that don't respond after a specified number of keep-alive requests. For example, your environment could experience a nonresponsive endpoint when an OPC UA server stops responding because of a power outage. 

For each distinct publishing interval to an OPC UA server, the application creates a separate subscription over which all nodes with this publishing interval are updated. 

### The OPC UA Discovery handler
OPC UA Discovery Handler, which is shipped along with OPC UA Broker, uses the Akri configuration to connect to an OPC UA server. After the connection is made, the discovery handler inspects the OPC UA address space, and tries to detect assets that are compliant with the OPC UA Device Information companion specification. 

After successful detection, the publishing process starts. 

## Common use cases
OPC UA Broker (preview) enables the following use cases that are common in industrial edge environments. 

- **Run as a container-based application**. OPC UA Broker is shipped as a component of Azure IoT Operations, which runs as a container-based application on a Kubernetes cluster.
- **Convert OPC UA data to MQTT**. OPC UA Broker uses OPC UA PubSub-compliant JSON data encoding to maximize interoperability. By using a common format for data exchange, you can reduce the risk of future sustainability issues that occur when you use custom JSON encoding. 
- **Simulate OPC UA data sources for testing**. You can use OPC UA Broker with any OPC simulation server and speed up the process of development applications that require OPC UA data.
