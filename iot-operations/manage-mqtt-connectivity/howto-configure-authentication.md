# Configure Azure IoT MQ authentication

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-note](../includes/public-preview-note.md)]

Azure IoT MQ supports multiple authentication methods for clients, and you can configure each listener to have its own authentication system with *BrokerAuthentication* resources.

## Default BrokerAuthentication resource

Azure IoT Operations deploys a default BrokerAuthentication resource named `authn` linked with the default listener named `listener` in the `azure-iot-operations` namespace. It's configured to only use Kubernetes Service Account Tokens (SATs) for authentication. To inspect it, run:

```bash
kubectl get brokerauthentication authn -n azure-iot-operations -o yaml
```

The output shows the default BrokerAuthentication resource, with metadata removed for brevity:

```yaml
apiVersion: mq.iotoperations.azure.com/v1beta1
kind: BrokerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: authn
  namespace: azure-iot-operations
spec:
  listenerRef:
    - listener
  authenticationMethods:
    - sat:
        audiences: ["aio-mq"]
```

To change the configuration, modify the `authenticationMethods` setting in this BrokerAuthentication resource or create new brand new BrokerAuthentication resource with a different name. Then, deploy it using `kubectl apply`.

## Relationship between BrokerListener and BrokerAuthentication

BrokerListener and BrokerAuthentication are separate resources, but they're linked together using `listenerRef`. The following rules apply:

* A BrokerListener can be linked to only one BrokerAuthentication
* A BrokerAuthentication can be linked to multiple BrokerListeners
* Each BrokerAuthentication can support multiple authentication methods at once

## Authentication flow

The order of authentication methods in the array determines how Azure IoT MQ authenticates clients. Azure IoT MQ tries to authenticate the client's credentials using the first specified method and iterates through the array until it finds a match or reaches the end.

For each method, Azure IoT MQ first checks if the client's credentials are *relevant* for that method. For example, SAT authentication requires a username starting with `sat://`, and X.509 authentication requires a client certificate. If the client's credentials are relevant, Azure IoT MQ then verifies if they're valid. For more information, see the [Configure authentication method](#configure-authentication-method) section.

For custom authentication, Azure IoT MQ treats failure to communicate with the custom authentication server as *credentials not relevant*. This behavior lets Azure IoT MQ fall back to other methods if the custom server is unreachable.

The authentication flow ends when:

* One of these conditions is true:
  * The client's credentials are relevant and valid for one of the methods.
  * The client's credentials aren't relevant for any of the methods.
  * The client's credentials are relevant but invalid for any of the methods.
* Azure IoT MQ either grants or denies access to the client based on the outcome of the authentication flow.

With multiple authentication methods, Azure IoT MQ has a fallback mechanism. For example:

```yaml
apiVersion: mq.iotoperations.azure.com/v1beta1
kind: BrokerAuthentication
metadata: 
  name: authn
  namespace: azure-iot-operations
spec:
  listenerRef:
    - listener
  authenticationMethods:
    - custom:
        # ...
    - sat:
        # ...
    - usernamePassword:
        # ...
```

The earlier example specifies custom, SAT, and [username-password authentication](#configure-authentication-method). When a client connects, Azure IoT MQ attempts to authenticate the client using the specified methods in the given order **custom > SAT > username-password**.

1. Azure IoT MQ checks if the client's credentials are valid for custom authentication. Since custom authentication relies on an external server to determine validity of credentials, the broker considers all credentials relevant to custom auth and forwards them to the custom authentication server.

1. If the custom authentication server responds with `Pass` or `Fail` result, the authentication flow ends. However, if the custom authentication server isn't available, then Azure IoT MQ falls back to the remaining specified methods, with SAT being next.

1. Azure IoT MQ tries to authenticate the credentials as SAT credentials. If the MQTT username starts with `sat://`, Azure IoT MQ evaluates the MQTT password as a SAT. Otherwise, the broker falls back to username-password and check if the provided MQTT username and password are valid.

If the custom authentication server is unavailable and all subsequent methods determined that the provided credentials aren't relevant, then the broker denies the client connection.

## Disable authentication

For testing, disable authentication by changing it in the [BrokerListener resource](howto-configure-brokerlistener.md).

```yaml
spec:
  authenticationEnabled: false
```

## Configure authentication method

To learn more about each of the authentication options, see the following sections:

## Username and password

Each client has the following required properties:

- Username
- Password ([PBKDF2 encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2))
- [Attributes for authorization](./howto-configure-authorization.md)

For example, start with a `clients.toml` with identities and PBKDF2 encoded passwords.

```toml
# Credential #1
# username: client1
# password: password
[client1]
password = "$pbkdf2-sha512$i=100000,l=64$HqJwOCHweNk1pLryiu3RsA$KVSvxKYcibIG5S5n55RvxKRTdAAfCUtBJoy5IuFzdSZyzkwvUcU+FPawEWFPn+06JyZsndfRTfpiEh+2eSJLkg"

[client1.attributes]
floor = "floor1"
site = "site1"

# Credential #2
# username: client2
# password: password2
[client2]
password = "$pbkdf2-sha512$i=100000,l=64$+H7jXzcEbq2kkyvpxtxePQ$jTzW6fSesiuNRLMIkDDAzBEILk7iyyDZ3rjlEwQap4UJP4TaCR+EXQXNukO7qNJWlPPP8leNnJDCBgX/255Ezw"

[client2.attributes]
floor = "floor2"
site = "site1"
```

To encode the password using PBKDF2, use the [Azure IoT Operations CLI extension](/cli/azure/iot/ops) that includes the `az iot ops mq get-password-hash` command. It generates a PBKDF2 password hash from a password phrase using the SHA-512 algorithm and a 128-bit randomized salt.

```bash
az iot ops mq get-password-hash --phrase TestPassword
```

The output shows the PBKDF2 password hash to copy:

```json
{
  "hash": "$pbkdf2-sha512$i=210000,l=64$4SnaHtmi7m++00fXNHMTOQ$rPT8BWv7IszPDtpj7gFC40RhhPuP66GJHIpL5G7SYvw+8rFrybyRGDy+PVBYClmdHQGEoy0dvV+ytFTKoYSS4A"
}
```

Then, save the file as `passwords.toml` and import it into a Kubernetes secret under that key.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic passwords-db --from-file=passwords.toml -n azure-iot-operations
```

Include a reference to the secret in the *BrokerAuthentication* custom resource

```yaml
spec:
  authenticationMethods:
    - usernamePassword:
        secretName: passwords-db
```

It might take a few minutes for the changes to take effect.

You can use Azure Key Vault to manage secrets for Azure IoT MQ instead of Kubernetes secrets. To learn more, see [Manage secrets using Azure Key Vault or Kubernetes secrets](../manage-mqtt-connectivity/howto-manage-secrets.md).

## X.509 client certificate

### Prerequisites

- Azure IoT MQ configured with [TLS enabled](howto-configure-brokerlistener.md).
- [Step-CLI](https://smallstep.com/docs/step-cli/installation/)
- Client certificates and the issuing certificate chain in PEM files. If you don't have any, use Step CLI to generate some.
- Familiarity with public key cryptography and terms like root CA, private key, and intermediate certificates.

Both EC and RSA keys are supported, but all certificates in the chain must use the same key algorithm. If you're importing your own CA certificates, ensure that the client certificate uses the same key algorithm as the CAs.

### Import trusted client root CA certificate

A trusted root CA certificate is required to validate the client certificate. To import a root certificate that can be used to validate client certificates, first import the certificate PEM as ConfigMap under the key `client_ca.pem`. Client certificates must be rooted in this CA for Azure IoT MQ to authenticate them.

```bash
kubectl create configmap client-ca --from-file=client_ca.pem -n azure-iot-operations
```

To check the root CA certificate is properly imported, run `kubectl describe configmap`. The result shows the same base64 encoding of the PEM certificate file.

```console
$ kubectl describe configmap client-ca
Name:         client-ca
Namespace:    azure-iot-operations

Data
====
client_ca.pem:
----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIBmzCCAUGgAwIBAgIQVAZ2I0ydpCut1imrk+fM3DAKBggqhkjOPQQDAjAsMRAw
...
t2xMXcOTeYiv2wnTq0Op0ERKICHhko2PyCGGwnB2Gg==
-----END CERTIFICATE-----


BinaryData
====
```

### Import certificate-to-attribute mapping

To use authorization policies for clients using properties on the X.509 certificates, create a certificate-to-attribute mapping TOML file and import it as a Kubernetes secret under the key `x509Attributes.toml`. This file maps the subject name of the client certificate to the attributes that can be used in authorization policies. It's required even if you don't use authorization policies.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic x509-attributes --from-file=x509Attributes.toml -n azure-iot-operations
```

To learn about the attributes file syntax, see [Authorize clients that use X.509 authentication](./howto-configure-authorization.md#authorize-clients-that-use-x509-authentication).

Like with username-password authentication, you can use Azure Key Vault to manage this secret for instead of Kubernetes secrets. To learn more, see [Manage secrets using Azure Key Vault or Kubernetes secrets](../manage-mqtt-connectivity/howto-manage-secrets.md).

### Enable X.509 client authentication

Finally, once the trusted client root CA certificate and the certificate-to-attribute mapping are imported, enable X.509 client authentication by adding `x509` as one of the authentication methods as part of a BrokerAuthentication resource linked to a TLS-enabled listener. For example:

```yaml
spec:
  authenticationMethods:
    - x509:
        trustedClientCaCert: client-ca
        attributes:
          secretName: x509-attributes
```

### Connect mosquitto client to Azure IoT MQ with X.509 client certificate

A client like mosquitto needs three files to be able to connect to Azure IoT MQ with TLS and X.509 client authentication. For example:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -q 1 -t hello -d -V mqttv5 -m world -i thermostat \
-h "<IOT_MQ_EXTERNAL_IP>" \
--cert thermostat_cert.pem \
--key thermostat_key.pem \
--cafile chain.pem
```

In the example:

- The `--cert` parameter specifies the client certificate PEM file.
- The `--key` parameter specifies the client private key PEM file.
- The third parameter `--cafile` is the most complex: the trusted certificate database, used for two purposes:
  - When mosquitto client connects to Azure IoT MQ over TLS, it validates the server certificate. It searches for root certificates in the database to create a trusted chain to the server certificate. Because of this, the server root certificate needs to be copied into this file.
  - When the Azure IoT MQ requests a client certificate from mosquitto client, it also requires a valid certificate chain to send to the server. The `--cert` parameter tells mosquitto which certificate to send, but it's not enough. Azure IoT MQ can't verify this certificate alone because it also needs the intermediate certificate. Mosquitto uses the database file to build the necessary certificate chain. To support this, the `cafile` must contain both the intermediate and root certificates.

### Understand Azure IoT MQ X.509 client authentication flow

![Diagram of the X.509 client authentication flow.](./media/howto-configure-authentication/x509-client-auth-flow.svg)

The following are the steps for client authentication flow:

1. When X.509 client authentication is turned on, connecting clients must present its client certificate and any intermediate certificates to let Azure IoT MQ build a certificate chain rooted to one of its configured trusted certificates.
1. The load balancer directs the communication to one of the frontend brokers.
1. Once the frontend broker received the client certificate, it tries to build a certificate chain that's rooted to one of the configured certificates. The certificate is required for a TLS handshake. If the frontend broker successfully built a chain and the presented chain is verified, it finishes the TLS handshake. The connecting client is able to send MQTT packets to the frontend through the built TLS channel.
1. The TLS channel is open, but the client authentication or authorization isn't finished yet.
1. The client then sends a CONNECT packet to Azure IoT MQ.
1. The CONNECT packet is routed to a frontend again.
1. The frontend collects all credentials the client presented so far, like username and password fields, authentication data from the CONNECT packet, and the client certificate chain presented during the TLS handshake.
1. The frontend sends these credentials to the authentication service. The authentication service checks the certificate chain once again and collects the subject names of all the certificates in the chain.
1. The authentication service uses its [configured authorization rules](./howto-configure-authorization.md) to determine what attributes the connecting clients has. These attributes determine what operations the client can execute, including the CONNECT packet itself.
1. Authentication service returns decision to frontend broker.
1. The frontend broker knows the client attributes and if it's allowed to connect. If so, then the MQTT connection is completed and the client can continue to send and receive MQTT packets determined by its authorization rules.

## Kubernetes Service Account Tokens

Kubernetes Service Account Tokens (SATs) are JSON Web Tokens associated with Kubernetes Service Accounts. Clients present SATs to the Azure IoT MQ MQTT broker to authenticate themselves.

Azure IoT MQ uses *bound service account tokens* that are detailed in the [What GKE users need to know about Kubernetes' new service account tokens](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/kubernetes-bound-service-account-tokens) post. Here are the salient features from the post:

Launched in Kubernetes 1.13, and becoming the default format in 1.21, bound tokens address all of the limited functionality of legacy tokens, and more:

* The tokens themselves are harder to steal and misuse; they're time-bound, audience-bound, and object-bound.
* They adopt a standardized format: OpenID Connect (OIDC), with full OIDC Discovery, making it easier for service providers to accept them.
* They're distributed to pods more securely, using a new Kubelet projected volume type.

The broker verifies tokens using the [Kubernetes Token Review API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/authentication-resources/token-review-v1/). Enable Kubernetes `TokenRequestProjection` feature to specify `audiences` (default since 1.21). If this feature isn't enabled, SATs can't be used.

### Create a service account

To create SATs, first create a service account. The following command creates a service account called `mqtt-client`.

```bash
kubectl create serviceaccount mqtt-client -n azure-iot-operations
```

### Add attributes for authorization

Clients authentication via SAT can optionally have their SATs annotated with attributes to be used with custom authorization policies. To learn more, see [Authorize clients that use Kubernetes Service Account Tokens](./howto-configure-authentication.md).

### Enable Service Account Token (SAT) authentication

Modify the `authenticationMethods` setting in a BrokerAuthentication resource to specify `sat` as a valid authentication method. The `audiences` specifies the list of valid audiences for tokens. Choose unique values that identify the Azure IoT MQ's broker service. You must specify at least one audience, and all SATs must match one of the specified audiences.

```yaml
spec:
  authenticationMethods:
    - sat:
        audiences: ["aio-mq", "my-audience"]
```

Apply your changes with `kubectl apply`. It might take a few minutes for the changes to take effect.

### Test SAT authentication

SAT authentication must be used from a client in the same cluster as Azure IoT MQ. The following command specifies a pod that has the mosquitto client and mounts the SAT created in the previous steps into the pod.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mqtt-client
  namespace: azure-iot-operations
spec:
  serviceAccountName: mqtt-client
  containers:
  - image: efrecon/mqtt-client
    name: mqtt-client
    command: ["sleep", "infinity"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: mqtt-client-token
      mountPath: /var/run/secrets/tokens
  volumes:
  - name: mqtt-client-token
    projected:
      sources:
      - serviceAccountToken:
          path: mqtt-client-token
          audience: my-audience
          expirationSeconds: 86400
```

Here, the `serviceAccountName` field in the pod configuration must match the service account associated with the token being used. Also, The `serviceAccountToken.audience` field in the pod configuration must be one of the `audiences` configured in the BrokerAuthentication resource.

Once the pod has been created, start a shell in the pod:

```bash
kubectl exec --stdin --tty mqtt-client -n azure-iot-operations -- sh
```

The token is mounted at the path specified in the configuration `/var/run/secrets/tokens` in the previous example. Retrieve the token and use it to authenticate.

```bash
token=$(cat /var/run/secrets/tokens/mqtt-client-token)

mosquitto_pub -h aio-mq-dmqtt-frontend -V mqttv5 -t hello -m world -u '$sat' -P "$token"
```

The MQTT username must be set to `$sat`. The MQTT password must be set to the SAT itself.

### Refresh service account tokens

Service account tokens are valid for a limited time and configured with `expirationSeconds`. However, Kubernetes [automatically refreshes the token before it expires](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/service-accounts-admin/). The token is refreshed in the background, and the client doesn't need to do anything other than to fetch it again.

For example, if the client is a pod that uses the token mounted as a volume, like in the [test SAT authentication](#test-sat-authentication) example, then the latest token is available at the same path `/var/run/secrets/tokens/mqtt-client-token`. When making a new connection, the client can fetch the latest token and use it to authenticate. The client should also have a mechanism to handle MQTT unauthorized errors by fetching the latest token and retrying the connection.

## Custom authentication

Extend client authentication beyond the provided authentication methods with custom authentication. It's *pluggable* since the service can be anything as long as it adheres to the API. 

When a client connects to Azure IoT MQ and custom authentication is enabled, Azure IoT MQ delegates the verification of client credentials to a custom authentication server with an HTTP request along with all credentials the client presents. The custom authentication server responds with approval or denial for the client with the client's [attributes for authorization](./howto-configure-authorization.md).

### Create custom authentication service

The custom authentication server is implemented and deployed separately from Azure IoT MQ.

A sample custom authentication server and instructions are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/explore-iot-operations/tree/main/samples/auth-server-template). Use this sample as a template can and starting point for implementing your own custom authentication logic.

#### API

The API between Azure IoT MQ and the custom authentication server follow the API specification for custom authentication. The OpenAPI specification is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/explore-iot-operations/blob/main/samples/auth-server-template/api.yaml).

#### HTTPS with TLS encryption is required

Azure IoT MQ sends requests containing sensitive client credentials to the custom authentication server. To protect these credentials, communication between Azure IoT MQ and custom authentication server must be encrypted with TLS.

The custom authentication server must present a server certificate, and Azure IoT MQ must have a trusted root CA certificate for validating the server certificate. Optionally, the custom authentication server might require Azure IoT MQ to present a client certificate to authenticate itself.

### Enable custom authentication for a listener

Modify the `authenticationMethods` setting in a BrokerAuthentication resource to specify `custom` as a valid authentication method. Then, specify the parameters required to communicate with a custom authentication server.

This example shows all possible parameters. The exact parameters required depend on each custom server's requirements.

```yaml
spec:
  authenticationMethods:
    - custom:
        # Endpoint for custom authentication requests. Required.
        endpoint: https://auth-server-template
        # Trusted CA certificate for validating custom authentication server certificate.
        # Required unless the server certificate is publicly-rooted.
        caCert: custom-auth-ca
        # Authentication between Azure IoT MQ with the custom authentication server.
        # The broker may present X.509 credentials or no credentials to the server.
        auth:
          x509:
            secretName: custom-auth-client-cert
            namespace: azure-iot-operations
        # Optional additional HTTP headers that the broker will send to the
        # custom authentication server.
        headers:
          header_key: header_value
```
