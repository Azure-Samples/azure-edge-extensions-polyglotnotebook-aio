# Manage secrets using Azure Key Vault or Kubernetes secrets

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-note](../includes/public-preview-note.md)]

You can use [Azure Key Vault](/azure/key-vault/general/basic-concepts) to manage secrets for your Azure IoT MQ distributed MQTT broker instead of Kubernetes secrets. This article shows you how to set up Key Vault for your broker and use it to manage secrets.

## Prerequisites

- [An Azure Key Vault instance](/azure/key-vault/quick-create-portal) with a secret.
- [An Microsoft Entra service principal](/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal) with `get` and `list` permissions for secrets in the Key Vault instance. To configure the service principal for Key Vault permissions, see [Assign a Key Vault access policy](/azure/key-vault/general/assign-access-policy?tabs=azure-portal).
- [A Kubernetes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) with the service principal's credentials, like this example with the default `aio-akv-sp` secret:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: aio-akv-sp
      namespace: azure-iot-operations
    type: Opaque
    data:
      clientid: <base64 encoded client id>
      clientsecret: <base64 encoded client secret>
    ```

## Use Azure Key Vault for secret management

The `keyVault` field is available wherever Kubernetes secrets (`secretName`) are used. The following table describes the properties of the `keyVault` field.

| Property | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| vault | Yes | Specifies the Azure Key Vault that contains the secrets. |
| vault.name | Yes | Specifies the name of the Azure Key Vault. To get the Key Vault name from Azure portal, navigate to the Key Vault instance and copy the name from the Overview page. |
| vault.directoryId | Yes | Specifies the Microsoft Entra tenant ID. To get the tenant ID from Azure portal, navigate to the Key Vault instance and copy the tenant ID from the Overview page. |
| vault.credentials.servicePrincipalLocalSecretName | Yes | Specifies the name of the secret that contains the service principal credentials. |
| vaultSecret | Yes, when using regular Key Vault secrets | Specifies the secret in the Azure Key Vault. |
| vaultSecret.name | Yes | Specifies the name of the secret. |
| vaultSecret.version | No | Specifies the version of the secret. |
| vaultCert | Yes, when using Key Vault certificates | Specifies the certificate in the Azure Key Vault. |
| vaultCert.name | Yes | Specifies the name of the certificate secret. |
| vaultCert.version | No | Specifies the version of the certificate secret. |
| vaultCaChainCert | Yes, when using certificate chain | Specifies the certificate chain in the Azure Key Vault. |
| vaultCaChainCert.name | Yes | Specifies the name of the certificate chain. |
| vaultCaChainCert.version | No | Specifies the version of the certificate chain. |

The type of secret you're using determines which of the following fields you can use:

- `vaultSecret`: Use this field when you're using a regular secret. For example, you can use this field for configuring a *BrokerAuthentication* resource with the `usernamePassword` field.
- `vaultCert`: Use this field when you're using the certificate type secret with client certificate and key. For example, you can use this field for enabling TLS on a *BrokerListener*.
- `vaultCaChainCert`: Use this field when you're using a regular Key Vault secret that contains the CA chain of the client certificate. This field is for when you need IoT MQ to present the CA chain of the client certificate to a remote connection. For example, you can use this field for configuring a *MqttBridgeConnector* resource with the `remoteBrokerConnection` field.

## Examples

For example, to create a TLS *BrokerListener* that uses Azure Key Vault for secret the server certificate, use the following YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: mq.iotoperations.azure.com/v1beta1
kind: BrokerListener
metadata:
  name: tls-listener-manual
  namespace: azure-iot-operations
spec:
  brokerRef: broker
  authenticationEnabled: true
  authorizationEnabled: false
  port: 8883
  tls:
    keyVault:
      vault:
        name: my-key-vault
        directoryId: <AKV directory ID>
        credentials:
          servicePrincipalLocalSecretName: aio-akv-sp
      vaultCert:
        name: my-server-certificate
        version: latest
```

This next example shows how to use Azure Key Vault for the `usernamePassword` field in a BrokerAuthentication resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: mq.iotoperations.azure.com/v1beta1
kind: BrokerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: my-authentication
  namespace: azure-iot-operations
spec:
  listenerRef: 
    - tls-listener-manual
  authenicationMethods:
    - usernamePassword:
        keyVault:
          vault:
            name: my-key-vault
            directoryId: <AKV directory ID>
            credentials:
              servicePrincipalLocalSecretName: aio-akv-sp
          vaultSecret:
            name: my-username-password-db
            version: latest
```

This example shows how to use Azure Key Vault for MQTT bridge remote broker credentials:

```yaml
apiVersion: mq.iotoperations.azure.com/v1beta1
kind: MqttBridgeConnector
metadata:
  name: my-bridge
  namespace: azure-iot-operations
spec:
  image:
    repository: mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotoperations/mqttbridge
    tag: 0.1.0-preview
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  protocol: v5
  bridgeInstances: 1
  remoteBrokerConnection:
    endpoint: example.broker.endpoint:8883
    tls:
      tlsEnabled: true
      trustedCaCertificateConfigMap: my-ca-certificate
    authentication:
      x509:
        keyVault:
          vault:
            name: my-key-vault
            directoryId: <AKV directory ID>
            credentials:
              servicePrincipalLocalSecretName: aio-akv-sp
          vaultCaChainCert:
            name: my-remote-broker-certificate
            version: latest
```
