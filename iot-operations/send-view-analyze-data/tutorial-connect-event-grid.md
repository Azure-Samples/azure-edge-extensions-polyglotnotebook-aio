# Tutorial: Configure MQTT bridge between IoT MQ and Azure Event Grid

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-note](../includes/public-preview-note.md)]

In this tutorial, you learn how to configure IoT MQ for bi-directional MQTT bridge with Azure Event Grid MQTT broker PaaS. You can use this feature to process your IoT data at the edge and in the cloud. For example, you can use IoT MQ to process telemetry data at the edge, and then bridge the data to Azure Event Grid for further processing in the cloud.

## Prerequisites

* [Deploy Azure IoT Operations](../get-started/quickstart-deploy.md)

## Create Event Grid namespace with MQTT broker enabled

[Create Event Grid namespace](../../event-grid/create-view-manage-namespaces.md) with Azure CLI. Replace `<EG_NAME>`, `<RESOURCE_GROUP>`, and `<LOCATION>` with your own values. The location should be the same as the one you used to deploy Azure IoT Operations.

```azurecli
az eventgrid namespace create -n <EG_NAME> -g <RESOURCE_GROUP> --location <LOCATION> --topic-spaces-configuration "{state:Enabled,maximumClientSessionsPerAuthenticationName:3}"
```

By setting the `topic-spaces-configuration`, this command creates a namespace with:

* MQTT broker **enabled**
* Maximum client sessions per authentication name as **3**.

The max client sessions option allows IoT MQ to spawn multiple instances and still connect. To learn more, see [multi-session support](../../event-grid/mqtt-establishing-multiple-sessions-per-client.md).

## Create a topic space

In the Event Grid namespace, create a topic space named `tutorial` with a topic template `telemetry/#`. Replace `<EG_NAME>` and `<RESOURCE_GROUP>` with your own values.

```azurecli
az eventgrid namespace topic-space create -g <RESOURCE_GROUP> --namespace-name <EG_NAME> --name tutorial --topic-templates "telemetry/#"
```

By using the `#` wildcard in the topic template, you can publish to any topic under the `telemetry` topic space. For example, `telemetry/temperature` or `telemetry/humidity`.

## Give IoT MQ access to the Event Grid topic space

Using `az k8s-extension show`, find the principal ID for the Azure IoT MQ Arc extension.

```azurecli
az k8s-extension show --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --cluster-name <CLUSTER_NAME> --name mq --cluster-type connectedClusters --query identity.principalId -o tsv
```

Take note of the output value for `identity.principalId`, which is a GUID value with the following format:

```output
d84481ae-9181-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Then, use Azure CLI to assign publisher and subscriber roles to IoT MQ for the topic space you created. Replace `<MQ_ID>` with the principal ID you found in the previous step, and replace `<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>`, `<RESOURCE_GROUP>`, `<EG_NAME>` with your values matching the Event Grid namespace you created.

```azurecli
az role assignment create --assignee <MQ_ID> --role "EventGrid TopicSpaces Publisher" --role "EventGrid TopicSpaces Subscriber" --scope /subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourceGroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP>/providers/Microsoft.EventGrid/namespaces/<EG_NAME>/topicSpaces/tutorial
```

> [!TIP]
> The scope matches the `id` of the topic space you created with `az eventgrid namespace topic-space create` in the previous step, and you can find it in the output of the command.

## Event Grid MQTT broker hostname

Use Azure CLI to get the Event Grid MQTT broker hostname. Replace `<EG_NAME>` and `<RESOURCE_GROUP>` with your own values.

```azurecli
az eventgrid namespace show -g <RESOURCE_GROUP> -n <EG_NAME> --query topicSpacesConfiguration.hostname -o tsv
```

Take note of the output value for `topicSpacesConfiguration.hostname` that is a hostname value that looks like:

```output
example.region-1.ts.eventgrid.azure.net
```

## Create an MQTT bridge connector and topic map resources

In a new file named `bridge.yaml`, specify the MQTT bridge connector and topic map configuration. Replace the placeholder value in `endpoint` with the Event Grid MQTT hostname from the previous step.

```yaml
apiVersion: mq.iotoperations.azure.com/v1beta1
kind: MqttBridgeConnector
metadata:
  name: tutorial-bridge
  namespace: azure-iot-operations
spec:
  image: 
    repository: mcr.microsoft.com/azureiotoperations/mqttbridge
    tag: 0.1.0-preview
    pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  protocol: v5
  bridgeInstances: 2
  logLevel: debug
  remoteBrokerConnection:
    endpoint: example.region-1.ts.eventgrid.azure.net:8883
    tls:
      tlsEnabled: true
    authentication:
      systemAssignedManagedIdentity:
        audience: https://eventgrid.azure.net
  localBrokerConnection:
    endpoint: aio-mq-dmqtt-frontend:8883
    tls:
      tlsEnabled: true
      trustedCaCertificateConfigMap: aio-ca-trust-bundle-test-only
    authentication:
      kubernetes: {}
---
apiVersion: mq.iotoperations.azure.com/v1beta1
kind: MqttBridgeTopicMap
metadata:
  name: tutorial-topic-map
  namespace: azure-iot-operations 
spec:
  mqttBridgeConnectorRef: tutorial-bridge
  routes:
    - direction: local-to-remote
      name: publish
      source: tutorial/local
      target: telemetry/iot-mq
      qos: 1
    - direction: remote-to-local
      name: subscribe
      source: telemetry/#
      target: tutorial/cloud
      qos: 1
```

You configure the MQTT bridge connector to:

* Use the Event Grid MQTT broker as the remote broker
* Use the local IoT MQ broker as the local broker
* Use TLS for both remote and local brokers
* Use system-assigned managed identity for authentication to the remote broker
* Use Kubernetes service account for authentication to the local broker
* Use the topic map to map the `tutorial/local` topic to the `telemetry/iot-mq` topic on the remote broker
* Use the topic map to map the `telemetry/#` topic on the remote broker to the `tutorial/cloud` topic on the local broker

When you publish to the `tutorial/local` topic on the local IoT MQ broker, the message is bridged to the `telemetry/iot-mq` topic on the remote Event Grid MQTT broker. Then, the message is bridged back to the `tutorial/cloud` topic on the local IoT MQ broker. Similarly, when you publish to the `telemetry/iot-mq` topic on the remote Event Grid MQTT broker, the message is bridged to the `tutorial/cloud` topic on the local IoT MQ broker.

Apply the deployment file with kubectl.

```bash
kubectl apply -f bridge.yaml
```

```output
mqttbridgeconnector.mq.iotoperations.azure.com/tutorial-bridge created
mqttbridgetopicmap.mq.iotoperations.azure.com/tutorial-topic-map created
```

### Verify MQTT bridge deployment

Use kubectl to check the two bridge instances are ready and running.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n azure-iot-operations -l app=aio-mq-mqttbridge
```

```output
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
aio-mq-tutorial-bridge-0   1/1     Running   0          45s
aio-mq-tutorial-bridge-1   1/1     Running   0          45s
```

You can now publish on the local broker and subscribe to the Event Grid MQTT Broker and verify messages flow as expected.

## Deploy MQTT client

To verify the MQTT bridge is working, deploy an MQTT client to the same namespace as IoT MQ. In a new file named `client.yaml`, specify the client deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mqtt-client
  namespace: azure-iot-operations
spec:
  serviceAccountName: mqtt-client
  containers:
  - image: alpine
    name: mqtt-client
    command: ["sh", "-c"]
    args: ["apk add mosquitto-clients mqttui && sleep infinity"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: mq-sat
      mountPath: /var/run/secrets/tokens
    - name: trust-bundle
      mountPath: /var/run/certs
  volumes:
  - name: mq-sat
    projected:
      sources:
      - serviceAccountToken:
          path: mq-sat
          audience: aio-mq
          expirationSeconds: 86400
  - name: trust-bundle
    configMap:
      name: aio-ca-trust-bundle-test-only
```

Apply the deployment file with kubectl.

```bash
kubectl apply -f client.yaml
```

```output
pod/mqtt-client created
```

## Start a subscriber

Use `kubectl exec` to start a shell in the mosquitto client pod.

```bash
kubectl exec --stdin --tty mqtt-client -n azure-iot-operations -- sh
```

Inside the shell, start a subscriber to the IoT MQ broker on the `tutorial/#` topic space with *mqttui*.

```bash
mqttui log "tutorial/#" \
-b mqtts://aio-mq-dmqtt-frontend:8883 \
-u '$sat' \
--password $(cat /var/run/secrets/tokens/mq-sat) \
--insecure
```

Leave the command running and open a new terminal window.

## Publish MQTT messages to the cloud via the bridge

In a new terminal window, start another shell in the mosquitto client pod.

```bash
kubectl exec --stdin --tty mqtt-client -n azure-iot-operations -- sh
```

Inside the shell, use mosquitto to publish five messages to the `tutorial/local` topic.

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h aio-mq-dmqtt-frontend -p 8883 \
-m "This message goes all the way to the cloud and back!" \
-t "tutorial/local" -u '$sat' -P $(cat /var/run/secrets/tokens/mq-sat) \
--cafile /var/run/certs/ca.crt \
--repeat 5 --repeat-delay 1 -d
```

## View the messages in the subscriber

In the subscriber shell, you see the messages you published.

```output
23:17:50.802 QoS:AtMostOnce  tutorial/local     Payload( 52): This message goes all the way to the cloud and back!
23:17:51.086 QoS:AtMostOnce  tutorial/cloud     Payload( 52): This message goes all the way to the cloud and back!
23:17:51.803 QoS:AtMostOnce  tutorial/local     Payload( 52): This message goes all the way to the cloud and back!
23:17:51.888 QoS:AtMostOnce  tutorial/cloud     Payload( 52): This message goes all the way to the cloud and back!
23:17:52.804 QoS:AtMostOnce  tutorial/local     Payload( 52): This message goes all the way to the cloud and back!
23:17:52.888 QoS:AtMostOnce  tutorial/cloud     Payload( 52): This message goes all the way to the cloud and back!
23:17:53.805 QoS:AtMostOnce  tutorial/local     Payload( 52): This message goes all the way to the cloud and back!
23:17:53.895 QoS:AtMostOnce  tutorial/cloud     Payload( 52): This message goes all the way to the cloud and back!
23:17:54.807 QoS:AtMostOnce  tutorial/local     Payload( 52): This message goes all the way to the cloud and back!
23:17:54.881 QoS:AtMostOnce  tutorial/cloud     Payload( 52): This message goes all the way to the cloud and back!
```

Here, you see the messages are published to the local IoT MQ broker to the `tutorial/local` topic, bridged to Event Grid MQTT broker, and then bridged back to the local IoT MQ broker again on the `tutorial/cloud` topic. The messages are then delivered to the subscriber. In this example, the round trip time is about 80 ms.

## Check Event Grid metrics to verify message delivery

You can also check the Event Grid metrics to verify the messages are delivered to the Event Grid MQTT broker. In the Azure portal, navigate to the Event Grid namespace you created. Under **Metrics** > **MQTT: Successful Published Messages**. You should see the number of messages published and delivered increase as you publish messages to the local IoT MQ broker.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you learned how to configure IoT MQ for bi-directional MQTT bridge with Azure Event Grid MQTT broker. As next steps, explore the following scenarios:

* To use an MQTT client to publish messages directly to the Event Grid MQTT broker, see [Publish MQTT messages to Event Grid MQTT broker](../../event-grid/mqtt-publish-and-subscribe-cli.md). Give the client a [publisher permission binding](../../event-grid/mqtt-access-control.md) to the topic space you created, and you can publish messages to any topic under the `telemetry`, like `telemetry/temperature` or `telemetry/humidity`. All of these messages are bridged to the `tutorial/cloud` topic on the local IoT MQ broker.
* To set up routing rules for the Event Grid MQTT broker, see [Configure routing rules for Event Grid MQTT broker](../../event-grid/mqtt-routing.md). You can use routing rules to route messages to different topics based on the topic name, or to filter messages based on the message content.
